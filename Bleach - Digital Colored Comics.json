  "description": "Ichigo Kurosaki has always been able to see ghosts, but this ability doesn't change his life nearly as much as his close encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper and member of the mysterious Soul Society. While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family, but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits, and along with Rukia, who is slowly regaining her powers, it's Ichigo's job to both protect the innocent from Hollows and to help the spirits themselves find peace.\n\nMonochrome version won the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award in the Shounen category.\n\n↓ NOTES ↓\nHuge thanks to KojoUn/KojoZero for managing the content and uploading them to Nyaa.si!\nNyaa.si link: https://nyaa.si/view/1448524\nColored Manga/Colored Council Discord server: https://discord.com/invite/HnMuRzuxMu\nColored Manga/Colored Council website: https://coloredmanga.com/\nColored Manga Translation Squad Mangadex group link (Inactive): https://mangadex.org/group/6e97aaae-526f-44eb-9d3b-d4cfea78ae88/colored-manga-translation-squad\nPhantom troop Mangadex group link: https://mangadex.org/group/4896da4c-638d-4c87-a669-6986bfce4fc2/phantom-troop\n\nAlso, the dates for Vol.1 - Vol.54 will be very inaccurate due to a lack of information, the Colored Manga website has been down for awhile as of writing this so I cannot check the release date but when it's back up again I'll defintely fix it!\n\nNotice anything missing or incorrect?
